# 65 - Double a Number Represented as a Linked List

🔗 [LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list/)  
📌 Difficulty: Medium  
📚 Topic: Linked List  
🖥️ Language: Java  

## 💡 Approach
1. Use recursion or a stack to process digits from the end.  
2. Double each node’s value and keep track of carry.  
3. Update current node value to `(value * 2 + carry) % 10`.  
4. Carry becomes `(value * 2 + carry) / 10`.  
5. If carry is left after processing head, insert a new node at the front.  

## ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time:** O(n) → each node is processed once.  
- **Space:** O(n) in case of recursion/stack, O(1) with iterative reversal.
